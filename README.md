Created a project with 5 endpoints and three controller and service files.
1. a endpoint generates 8 unique responses. One controller
2. 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is  higher or lower than the number guessed.
    Easy Mode 1-10
    Medium Mode 1-50
    Hard Mode 1-100
3. 1 endpoint that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant based on the category chosen. 10 Restaurants per category.

Comments: Everything looks good and works well, the guess it is set up properly, the restaurant picker is good, and the 8ball works. Great Work!
